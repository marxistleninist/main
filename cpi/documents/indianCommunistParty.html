    </p>

    <center><h4>Principles</h4></center>
    <p>
      (1) Our party holds it is unnatural and unjust for any nation or 
      country to rule another nation or country, and therefore, it is 
      the birth right and the foremost duty of Indians to gain Complete
      Swarajya at the earliest possible time.<br/>

      (2) Our party holds that Indian Society as at present constituted,
      is based upon the ownership of the means of living(that is, land, factories,
      and means of transportation) by the capitalist or the master class and the consequent
      enslavement of the working class by whose labour alone wealth is produced.<br/>

      (3) Our party holds that in society, therefore, there is an antagonism
      interests manifesting itself as a class struggle between those who
      posses but do not produce and those who produce but do not possess.<br/>

      (4) Our party holds that this antagonism can be abolished only by the 
      emancipation of the working class from the domination of the master class
      by the conversion of the common property of the society, of the 
      means of production and distribution and their control byt the whole community.<br/>

      (5) Our party holds that, as in the order of social evolution the working
      class is the last class to achieve its freedom. The emancipation of the working
      class will involve the emancipation of all mankind without the distinction of 
      race and sects.<br/>

      (6) Our party holds that this emancipation must be the work of the working class itself.<br/>

      (7) Our party holds that the present Zamindari System is the sole cause of all
      the miseries of the Indian peasants and so long as it exists there is no hope 
      of improving their condition. Therefore the zamindari system must be abolished
      at once, and the peasants should be deemed as the rightful masters of the 
      fruits of their labour.<br/>
      (8) Our party holds that, as the machinery of the Govt., including the 
      armed forces of the nation exists only to conserve the monopoly by the
      capitalist class, of the wealth taken from the workers, the working class
      must organise consciously and politically for the conquest of the powers
      Government, national, provincial and local, in order that this machinery,
      including these forces, may be converted from an instrument of opression into
      the agent of emancipation and the overthrow of buearocratic and capitalistic 
      privileges.<br/>
      (9) Our party holds that, as political parties are but the expression
      of class interests, and as the working class is the biggest of all classes,
      so much so that all sections of the master class put together will, comparatively,
      infinitesmal, the interest of all the other classes must be superseded by the 
      interest of the working class wherever there comes a clash between any such interests.<br/>
      (10) Our party holds that the workers of all countries of the world are suffering from 
      the same unjustice at the hands of the capitalists, and that their interests
      are one and the same, it is therefore, necessary for their salvation to unite
      and act harmoniously.<br/>
      (11) The Indian Communist Party, therefore, enters the field of political action
      determined to supersede or envelope, all such parties whether alleged order
      avowedly capitalist and calls upon all the members of the working class of this
      country to muster under its banner to the end, that a speedy termination
      may be wrought to the system which deprives them of the fruits of their labour,
      and that poverty may give place to comfort, priviliges to equality and slavery to freedom.
